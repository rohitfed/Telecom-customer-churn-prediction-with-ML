# Customer Churn Analytics in Telecommunications

**Our primary goal is to understand and predict customer churn in a telecom company using available data. Predicting churn allows the company to target customers with retention strategies, ultimately saving potential revenue.**

# Key Steps in the Analysis
**1. Data Inspection**
Checking the quality and reliability of the data.

**2. Feature Engineering**
Handling bad data, anomalies, wrong data types, duplicate values, and outliers.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Understanding the distribution and relationships in the data.

**4. Pre-processing**
Label encoding, scaling (Z-score method) for numerical features.

**5. Model Implementation**
Utilizing Logistic Regression for predicting churn.

**6. Evaluation**
Assessing model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.

**7. Prediction on New Data (DFA**)
Applying the trained model to predict potential churners in a new dataset.
